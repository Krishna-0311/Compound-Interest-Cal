# Compund-Interest-Cal

Compound Interest (also known as compounding interest__) is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Believed to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as â€œinterest on interest". It will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount.
